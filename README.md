# Mangareader backend
##### backend for a mangareader android application. based off the design we made for 
##### our own software engineering class's book store project, this repository can be used as a
##### guide for our future work, since a manga (stored in pdf) is very similar in nature to a book.
##### extremely annoyed since we had a bad time participating in a coding contest, so i'll be pulling
##### an all-nighter to see if i can finish this up by tomorrow morning.
#### EDIT: managed to finish it in a night, which helped release some of my frustration. sorry to my teammates for ruining the contest
